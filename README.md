# PULSE


### Real-time Heart monitoring system by using IoT and deep neural networks (AI) to avoid unforeseen circumstances
------
#### List of Hardware Equipment's to be used :

    1. AVR Microcontroller
    2. Pulse rate sensor
    3. Temperature sensor(LM35)
    4. Blood pressure sensor
    5. Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266)

#### Description

```
Cardiovascular disease is the leading global cause of death, accounting for more than 17.3 million deaths per year, a number that is expected to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030. In India, most of the deaths are due to the negligence of people towards regular checkups and late treatment.

The internet of things (IoT) has been widely used to interconnect the available resources and offer effective health care services. we are going to monitor an individual's pulse rate
and blood pressure by using an armband which consists of a pulse rate sensor and blood pressure sensor implanted in a microcontroller. The process is based on the principle of
photoplethysmography. This armband is connected to our smartphone application which consists of a neural network model. Based on the individual, this model gets trained under
different conditions which helps in detecting the change in his health condition. In a critical situation, this application calls the emergency services to reach the current location and alert family
members.
